    <ul>
      <li>The acrobot system includes two joints and two links, where the joint between the two links is actuated.
      <li>Initially, the links are hanging downwards, and the goal is to swing the end of the lower link up to a given height.
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>A pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a frictionless track.
      <li>The system is controlled by applying a force of +1 or -1 to the cart.
      <li>The pendulum starts upright, and the goal is to prevent it from falling over.
      <li>A reward of +1 is provided for every timestep that the pole remains upright
      <li>The episode ends when the pole is more than 15 degrees from vertical, or the cart moves more than 2.4 units from the center.

    <ul>
      <li>A car is on a one-dimensional track, positioned between two "mountains".
      <li>The goal is to drive up the mountain on the right; however, the car's engine is not strong enough to scale the mountain in a single pass. 
      <li>The only way to succeed is to drive back and forth to build up momentum.
    </ul>
  <li><a href="https://gym.openai.com/envs/Pendulum-v0/">Pendulum-v0</a>
    <ul>
      <li>The inverted pendulum swingup problem is a classic problem in the control literature. 
      <li>In this version of the problem, the pendulum starts in a random position, and the goal is to swing it up so it stays upright.
